"""
Given an integer array nums, return an array where each element i represents the product of all values in nums excluding nums[i].
Note: You may assume the product of all numbers within nums can safely fit within an integer range.

Ex: Given the following array numsâ€¦

nums = [1, 2, 3], return [6,3,2].
6 = 3 * 2 (we exclude 1)
3 = 3 * 1 (we exclude 2)
2 = 2 * 1 (we exclude 3)
