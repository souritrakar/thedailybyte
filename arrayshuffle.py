"""
This question is asked by Amazon. Given an array of integers, nums, sort the array in any manner such that when i is even, nums[i] is even and when i is odd, nums[i] is odd.
Note: It is guaranteed that a valid sorting of nums exists.

Ex: Given the following array numsâ€¦

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], one possible way to sort the array is [2,1,4,3]
